{"metadata":{"title":"This blog","date":"May 30, 2021","excerpt":null},"content":"<p>This blog is based on <a href=\"https://kit.svelte.dev/\">Svelte Kit</a>. The github for the <a href=\"https://github.com/svelteland/svelte-kit-blog-demo\">demo blog</a>. I had problem getting the blog up with the latest Svelte Kit so i created a skeleton site with Svelte kit and moved files from the demo blog site to get it working. It was before I knew what I wanted to write about so of course I didn't write it down... Perhaps I will test it again from scratch and if so I will write it down.</p>\n<p>The best part of the blog is the easy way to include code. As they quote on the demo blog site:\nWithout highlighting, code are just paragraphs of chaos...</p>\n<p>Just doing something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> highlight <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'rehype-highlight'</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> runner = unified()\n    .use(remark2rehype)\n    .use(highlight)\n    .use(rehypeStringify);\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's pretty cool.</p>"}
