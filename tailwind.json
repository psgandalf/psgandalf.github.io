I usually make smaller utility programs and Tailwind seems like a good choice. Being able to use it with Svelte Kit would be really nice. Since Svelte Kit is new there where not that many blogs describing it. I found that <a href=\"https://github.com/svelte-add\">svelte-add</a> did have a tailwindscss addon. When I first added it I got <a href=\"https://github.com/svelte-add/tailwindcss/issues/50\">this error</a>. A couple of day later when I tested it again i did install. So keep in mind that this is beta stuff and may aswell fail in another couple of days...</p>\n<h2>First run</h2>\n<p>When I started the site created with npm init svelte@next sitename that is the way to install Svelte Kit and choosing to create a skeleton project with nothing else. Do a npm i to install and then run npx svelte-add tailwindcss --jit. Running npm run dev the webpage worked but without tailwind working. Comparing with blogs i added a asset directory under src and added yet another css directory with a tailwind.css file containing:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">@import</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"tailwindcss/base\"</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">@import</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"tailwindcss/components\"</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">@import</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"tailwindcss/utilities\"</span>;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the routes folder I added a __layout.svelte file containing:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#x3C;<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span>></span><span class=\"javascript\">\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'/src/assets/css/tailwind.css'</span>\n</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#x3C;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span>></span>\n  \n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#x3C;<span class=\"hljs-name\">main</span>></span>\n   <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#x3C;<span class=\"hljs-name\">slot</span> /></span>\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&#x3C;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">main</span>></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now tailwind was working atleas in dev and built for node.</p>"}
